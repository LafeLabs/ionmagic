1. What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.  What is the problem?  Why is it hard?
- How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
- What's new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
- Who cares?
- If you're successful, what difference will it make?   What impact will success have? How will it be measured?
- What are the risks and the payoffs?
- How much will it cost?
- How long will it take?
- What are the midterm and final "exams" to check for success?  How will progress be measured?


I seek unification of materials and methods into a single set of techniques to interact physically with electric and magnetic fields interacting with machines, gasses and fluids found universally in our immediate environment.  The problem is that technology is broken up into many totally isolated pieces that no small group of humans can have any control over their environment, causing centralized authoritarian economic systems to flourish.  Unifying the practices and tools of our physical environment requires a complete realignment of ideas spanning what are currently called many disciplines.  This makes it hard to fund, hard to build a team for, and impossible to do as part of a "job".

Today "unification" is all about theory.  There is no unification of physical things. So one might say the state of the art today is an almost totally unrelated set of purely theoretical quests. This is limited in that as stated above, in that it has enslaved all of humanity to one giant machine.  

This concerns the very future of the human race. As of now we are all effectively enslaved by the Global Industrial Machine.  The goal is to free humanity. 

Cost will be what it costs for me to avoid having a job which interferes with the work for the foreseeable future, until such time as I can survive physically off this technology.  Perhaps 25k/year.  Ideally a unrelated job could make this work, to avoid capitalist distortion of the Work.
