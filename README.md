# Ion Magic


### Main Tool Set

- nails
- ferrites
- plastic triangle coil
- permanent magnet
- copper wires
- urine, other bodily fluids 
- creek water
- tap water
- sea water
- ice
- all elements of Action Geometry:
	- cardboard triangles

- rocks and sand
- cement, pavement, bricks
- plastic bags

### Systems

- bearings connecting sticks and bottles and more sticks
- levers to translate motion down in size to get nanometer control by hand.  From 1 mm which I think I can do by hand down to 1 nanometer is 10 million times, or 7 orders of magnitude.  
- generator from bike to 120 VAC
- generator from creek to 120 VAC
- generator from extreme winds to 120 VAC
- electrostatic generator using wind to charge a ball to several 10's of kV
- electrostatic motor
- reversible water pump using object captured inside the tube driven by standard coil
- electromechanical switches
- vibrational drive of fluids
- optical joints in plumbing with integrated microscopy
- plumbing to change scale from liters to nanoliters 
- valves and pumps operated by hand to control fluids through channels at all scales
- transconductance amplifiers that convert a small measured voltage to a large current change
- oscillators which can use an arbitrary negative differential resistance to drive a mode
- electrical illumination using standard LED system ripped from trash and in plastic which can be used for strobes as well as general illumination
- generic electrode probe
- pendulums
- mass on spring oscillators
- fluid oscillators
- gas oscillators(whistle)
- real time conversion of electrical information of a fluid to sound
- resonant transformers for creating electric arcs
- temperature controlled heat reactor based on fire and sun
- system for integrating all technology onto the human body as a wearable structure
- audio, video and text communication over long distances both purely analog and piggy backing on the enemy networks(capitalist Internet)
- data storage, editing and replay of audio, video and text
- air pump and control

Perhaps product is never the goal, and the systems can be used for *applications*, as needed.  There are many things one might do with a pump, but a pump is still a pump.  Or a motor, or a microscope or a strobe light or a transistor
